# LCP_A
Repository containing all the tasks and the final project carried out during the course Laboratory of Compatational Physics module A of the Physics of Data master's degree course at the University of Padua.

The [/Tasks](Tasks) folder contains exercises done about the python programming language. The topics covered are: Numpy, the OSMEN framework for data analysis, Pandas, data visualization, linear algebra, algorithms, Monte Carlo methods.

The [/Project](Project) folder contains the final project. The aim of the project, by observing a set of simulated binary black holes, was to understand the differences between binary black hole mergers whose progenitors evolved through a common envelope and binary black hole mergers whose progenitors evolved through a stable mass transfer (see [/Project/project_description_astro_mapelli.pdf](project_description_astro_mapelli.pdf) for more details).
